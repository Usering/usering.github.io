					<p>I'm Adam Schneider, a 16 year old dude that loves to code. When I was 12 years old, I decided to learn how to make games on a (not so) little site called <a href="http://www.roblox.com">ROBLOX</a>. ROBLOX is a site where you can make your own game or play other people's games. You can also make a good amount of money off of the site using their program called Developer Exchange. Developer Exchange is a system they made in late 2013 that allowed legitimate developers to trade their on-site cash "ROBUX" for real money. Up until I was 15, I was working my way up to semi-popularity on the site. From going to the local events held by ROBLOX and making cool things on the site, I became known by the some of the administration, I have made so many useful connections that I can use later on in life just by knowing them. I made a <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Usering_">Twitter</a> and to this day, I have acquired close to 4,000 followers- these are just normal people who followed me because I made something cool and they want to stay up to date on what I am working on. Over the summer, ROBLOX asked me if I wanted to have one of my games participate in one of their infamous sponsor events- of course I said yes. They gave me a good lump of cash just for participating in it, and it got my name known even more.</p>
					<p>Early 2014, I decided to learn how to develop for the web- which included me learning the basics (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) as well and branching off into PHP. With this knowledge, I made a well known site (until I shut it down mid-2015) that provided off-site APIs to fetch data from the ROBLOX servers. Often times, the site would get upwards of 200,000 hits per day- but with limited funds, I shut down the site. From then on, I knew I wanted to be a web developer. I was always interested in how web sites worked and the security of them. Many of the projects I have made have ended up being deleted because of lack of funding and not being smart enough to put it up on GitHub. Now with every one of my projects, I will put it on GitHub for everyone to see. </p>
					<p>Currently, I have been had a huge interest in making extensions for Google's Chrome browser. Whenever I start developing an extension for use with ROBLOX and post it on Twitter, people go mad about it and all they want is to have it installed. This is a great feeling, and definitely keeps you developing. If you go to the "Chrome Extensions" tab of my website, you can see what I have made.</p>
