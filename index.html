					<p>Hi I'm Adam Schneider. Cars and computers interest me. </p>

					<p>Growing up in Silicon Valley always gave me wonder about computers and just hoigfhdhjw software works. This always gave me something to do after school and kept me wondering (and staying out of trouble). In 2012, I finally learned how to code on a game I like to call ROBLOX. 4 years later, I have made enough money doing what I love on ROBLOX to buy myself my dream car. My family loves Volkswagens- they are the only cars we buy. We have in total 4 VW cars- a 2009 Jetta, a '62 Chop Top Bug, a '84 Syncro Weekender and an '89 Tristar- and soon going to be added is a Golf GTI (my car).</p>

					<p>On ROBLOX, I began programming small things and messing around in their model catalog- where people can publish anything they want for others to use and play with. From then on, my life goal was to become a professional software engineer (and I'm stilling working on it!) The first game I made on ROBLOX was simple and all you did was complete an obstacle course for nothing in return- which is how most of the games back then worked. In early 2015, ROBLOX asked me if I would like to participate in one of their Sponsor Events. Basically they would pay me a huge sum of money to create a game for an event that got cancelled. After that happened, a few months passed and they asked me again. This time, the event actually happened. The sponsor was Minions and ROBLOX wanted to me to add a collectible item in my game Speedy Hunt for people to pick up throughout the duration of the event. This got me good karma with the corporation. Now I just spend my days working on a game that may never be released- mainly due to time and creativity constraints.</p>

					<p>If you look at the top of this website, you can see I have a tab for 'Chrome Extensions.' This page shows all of the Chrome extensions I have created + a link to download them. This are what I have been focusing most of my time on the computer on this past year. </p>
